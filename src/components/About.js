            I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science from UC Santa Cruz. When I'm not coding, I enjoy snowboarding, exploring different types of streetwear fashion and design, and traveling. The pictures (not owned or taken by me) on this site represent the things that I enjoy in life.
